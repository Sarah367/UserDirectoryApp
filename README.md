# User Directory App
### This is an offline-first Android application that displays a list of 10 users fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API. The app uses Room 
### Database to store all of the data locally. It then displays the data from the local cache, meaning that the app will still work even without
### an internet connection. Users can also search for a specific user's name or email, filtering results directly from the Room database.
