# User Directory App
### This is an offline-first Android application that displays a list of 10 users fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API. The app uses Room Database to store all of the data locally. It then displays the data from the local cache, meaning that the app will still work even without an internet connection. Users can also search for a specific user's name or email, filtering results directly from the Room database.
